# claude-hooks → `conan-mods`

A Claude Code plugin (a mod: TypeScript hooks that run inside Claude Code) with
eight functions:

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `caveman` | Adds `~/.claude/skills/caveman/SKILL.md` to the session instructions. If the skill is missing, warns once per session with `npx skills@latest add C0nanT/skills`. |
| `git-guard` | Blocks destructive git commands (`push`, `reset --hard`, `clean -f`, `branch -D`, `checkout .`, `restore .`, `rm`), even with global options before the subcommand. |
| `dotenv-guard` | Blocks reading or editing `.env` / `.env.*` through Read, Edit, Write, MultiEdit and Bash. `.env.example`, `.env.sample`, `.env.dist` and `.env.template` stay allowed. |
| `secret-guard` | Blocks reading or editing credential files through Read, Edit, Write, MultiEdit and Bash: `~/.ssh/*` (except `known_hosts`, `config` and `*.pub`), `id_rsa`/`id_dsa`/`id_ecdsa`/`id_ed25519`, `~/.aws/credentials`, `~/.config/gcloud/`, `~/.azure/`, `*.pem`, `*.key`, `*.p12`, `*.pfx`, `.npmrc`, `.pypirc`, `.netrc`, `.git-credentials`, `~/.docker/config.json` and `~/.config/gh/hosts.yml`. In Bash the extension rules block only a file that exists, so code such as `row.key` passes; if the check fails, the command is blocked. |
| `rm-guard` | Blocks destructive shell commands: `rm -rf` (any flag spelling) on `/`, `/*`, `~`, `$HOME`, `..`, `../…`, a lone `*` or an absolute path outside the current directory, `chmod -R 777`, and `curl`/`wget` piped into `sh`, `bash` or `zsh`. Each part of a compound line is checked; `rm -rf node_modules` and other relative paths inside the project pass. |
| `sound` | Plays a sound when Claude finishes a task: `paplay` on Ubuntu, PowerShell beeps on WSL. No visual notification. |
| `statusline` | Draws the plugin's status line under the prompt: model, with the effort on its right when known (`[Low]`, `[Medium]`, `[High]`, `[XHigh]`, `[Max]`; it appears after the first turn, since the engine reports effort only then), `ctx:<pct>% <tokens>k`, session duration (`23m`, `1h05m`), `limit:<pct>% ↺ HH:MM` for the 5-hour rate-limit window and the git branch after the Nerd Font branch icon (` main`; without a Nerd Font it shows as a box). A field with no data is left out. Updates when the session opens and after each measurement; the duration restarts on `/clear`. Drawn in colour above the prompt while `statusline-color` is on, as plain text under it otherwise. |
| `statusline-color` | Draws the status line in colour in a band above the prompt: the model in bold, the rate limit green under 50%, yellow to 79% and red from 80%. Off, the line goes back under the prompt as plain text (that line cannot take colour). Does nothing while `statusline` is off. |

## Install

Inside Claude Code:

```
/plugin install conan-mods --marketplace C0nanT/claude-hooks
```

Install it in the user (global) scope. It needs no npm, `jq` or `settings.json`
edits.

**Coming from the old npm hooks?** Run the cleanup first on that PC, or the old
hooks run twice alongside the plugin. See [MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md).

## Update

```bash
claude plugin update conan-mods
```

Then run `/reload-plugins` inside any open session.

## `/conan-mods`

Everything starts **on**. The choice persists across sessions on the same PC.

```
/conan-mods                  # open the panel and list each function with on/off
/conan-mods git-guard off    # switch one off, effective immediately
/conan-mods git-guard on
```

With no argument, `/conan-mods` opens a focused `conan-mods` pane with one row per function (name, state, a
button). Pressing a button switches that function the same way the text command does, and the pane and the off band
redraw at once. Esc closes the pane and returns the prompt. The reply still carries the `name: on|off` list, for the
transcript and for places where the pane does not open.

Valid names: `caveman`, `git-guard`, `dotenv-guard`, `secret-guard`, `rm-guard`, `sound`, `statusline`, `statusline-color`. Anything else
prints the usage.

### The status line

The reset time is drawn in your local zone, resolved once per session in this order:
`STATUSLINE_TZ` (an IANA name such as `America/Sao_Paulo`), the host zone
(`timedatectl`, `/etc/timezone`, the `/etc/localtime` link; plain UTC is ignored),
and on WSL, when Linux still says UTC, the Windows zone read through PowerShell.
Effort shows from the first turn on. With `statusline-color` on, the coloured line sits above the
off band when both show.

### The off band

While any function is off, a one-line band above the prompt lists what is off,
in a fixed order:

```
⚠ off: git-guard · caveman
```

It disappears when everything is back on.

## Development

### Layout

```
.claude-plugin/plugin.json        # plugin manifest (version is written by CI)
.claude-plugin/marketplace.json   # marketplace with the single conan-mods entry
hooks/hooks.json                  # loads hooks/register.ts
hooks/register.ts                 # wires every event to the modules below
hooks/*-rules.ts, hooks/toggles.ts  # pure decision logic
hooks/*.test.ts                   # plugin tests
types/index.d.ts                  # types for the plugin's stored state
```

### Setup and local run

```bash
git config core.hooksPath .githooks   # pre-push validates and tests the plugin
claude --plugin-dir .                 # load the plugin from this folder
claude plugin validate .              # manifest, marketplace and hooks module
claude plugin test .                  # runs hooks/*.test.ts
```

To get `/reload-plugins` while editing, add the folder as a local marketplace:
`claude plugin marketplace add .` then `/plugin install conan-mods`.

### Releasing

| Where you push | What happens |
|----------------|--------------|
| Branch or PR | CI installs Claude Code and runs `claude plugin validate` + `claude plugin test` |
| `main` | Same checks → detect bump from commits → write the version to `plugin.json` and the marketplace entry → commit `[skip ci]` → tag `v<version>` |

Nothing is published to npm. The version is never edited by hand: the bump
comes from commit prefixes (`fix:` → patch, `feat:` → minor, `feat!:` /
`BREAKING CHANGE` → major). See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

### The old npm package

`@c0nant/claude-hooks` is deprecated on npm. Its last version (`0.4.x`) is only
a cleanup tool for the old hooks, and its source was removed from this repo at
the plugin release. [MIGRATING.md](MIGRATING.md) has the per-PC steps.
